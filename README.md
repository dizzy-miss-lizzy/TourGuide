# Tour Guide

A tour guide app for Newport, Oregon.

* Built for API 15 or higher
* 2 activities: MainActivity and DetailsActivity
* 5 fragments: Sights, Activities, Food, Lodging, and Events

## Basic structure:

MainActivity displays a ListView of objects contained in an ArrayList, which include information for an attraction according to each fragment category.
A user can click on a ListView item, which sends an explicit intent to the DetailsActivity and displays an added detailed description and location, usually a hyperlink.
